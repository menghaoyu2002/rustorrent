i wrote a bittorrent client in rust for fun

download speed is not too good from my testing i've seen the running average hit 1 MB/s at best.

didn't do uploading just yet so this client is just a leecher (sorry ðŸ˜¢)

some data corruption as well, hopefully i can sort that out. it's not too terrible though.
